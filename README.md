## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election with two modifications I'd like to suggest. This script mainly points out the winner and the most productive county. I feel if we could  highlight the county "Age" and "Gender". If we have the names why not put the age and gender as well? I feel like this will be beneficial for any future elective that'll like to run. The elective will know what demographic to targer to either raise votes in that certain demorgraphic or excel in that prospective demeorgraphic. This can be done by putting the "Count_Age" and "County_Gender" under the county votes. A picture of defining the Age and Gender for the modification is provided below.
